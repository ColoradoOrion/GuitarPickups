		<h2>History of guitar amplification</h2>
		<p class="clear">In the early 1900's, before the dawn of public address systems, bands performed unamplified to their audiences.
			This worked well for small ensembles, such string quartets or a singer with a guitar. However, as the size of bands grew
			with louders instruments, the imbalance became more apparent. Singers couldn't be heard over the trumpets. Guitars couldn't
			be heard over loud drum sets. Said an audience member to a young Les Paul, "I could hear your voice fine. I could hear
			your harmonica fine. â€¦ I couldn't hear your guitar." <sup>[<a href="#references" class="reference">1</a>]</sup></p>

		  <p>Early attepmts at amplifying regular guitars - those with hollow bodies - were problematic. The sound was less than
			desireable and they were prone to feeding back...that booming or wailing that happens with microphones. In the 1930's,
			Hawaiian music was extremely popular. The singature "Hawaiian" sound is created by the Hawaiian laptop guitar and it faced
			the same problems as other hollow body guitars. In 1932, the first electic Hawaiian laptop guitar was introduced <sup>[<a href="#references" class="reference">2</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#references" class="reference">3</a>]</sup>.
			Rather than a microphone to amplify the sound, it used a "pickup". A pickup is a magnet with wire wrapped around it. As
			the metal strings move back and forth over the magnet, an alternating current is induced into the wire, which can be sent
			directly to an amplifier. Because the body is no longer necessary to amplify the guitar, the body can be solid and no
			feedback occurs. The new Hawaiian guitar was extremely popular with players because they could compete with the volume
			of louder bands.</p>

		  <p>In the early 1950's, a man by the name of Leo Fender invented a solid body electric guitar. It was called the Broadcaster.
			Like the Hawaiian guitar, it had a solid body and electromagnetic pickups. It was designed to be mass produced and affordable.
			Fender later invented another solid body guitar called the Stratocaster, which became one of, if not the, most popular
			guitars ever made. It had three pickups with a switch that allowed the player to select which pickup is used. Stevie Ray
			Vaughn, Jimmi Hendricks and Bonnie Raitt are well-known Stratocaster players</p>

		  <p>After Leo Fender's success, Gibson enlisted a guitarist and inventor named Les Paul to design an electric guitar for
			them to compete with Fender. They had originally laughed at his invention (called "the Log"<sup>[<a href="#references" class="reference">4</a>]</sup>), but they realized he
			was their best bet at coming up with a unique product. The result was the Gibson Les Paul. Overtime, it became equal with
			the Stratocaster in popularity. Slash and Jimmy Page are known for playing Gibson Les Pauls.</p>

      <p>What's remarkable about these two guitars is that they create very different sounds despite being nearly identical in
      design. What differentiates them? The pickups.</p>

		<h2>Single Coil pickups</h2>
		<p>Leo Fender's Statocaster comes with three <em>single coil</em> pickups. That is, there is a single coil around the magnet. People describe single coil pickups as "clear", "bright", "shiny" and "bell-like". It's easy to hear the individual notes. There is a big drawback to them though: they are susceptible to noise and hum because the pickups act like an antenna. There is a solution: the <a href="#humbucker">humbucking pickup</a>.</p>

		<h2>Humbuckers</h2>
    <p>The idea of the humbucker actually predates the electric guitar. It was originally used originally for equipement rather than musical instruments. It wasn't until the 50's that they found their way into Les Paul's signature guitar. <sup>[<a href="#references" class="reference">5</a>]</sup></p>

      </div>

      <p>To prevent the pickups from amplifying noice and interference, some guitars use dual-coil, or "humbucking" pickups. These pickups use two single-coils next to each other in a single housing. They are wired in such a way that any noise or hum that goes into one coil is cancelled out by the other...all while letting the signal generated by the string through. Why don't all guitars use humbuckers? Because the noise cancellation comes at a cost. The high and low frequencies that make a single coil pickup sound "bell-like" are reduced to produce a more "heavy" sound. As it turns out, that tone sounds <em>fantastic</em> when pushed through an amplifier and distorted. If you're after a bright, single-coil sound, you need to revisit a guitar with single coil pickups.</p>

		<h2>Using pickups together</h2>
    <p>Pickups, whether they are single or dual coil, sound different depending on where on the body they are placed. When they are near the bridge of the guitar, they sound brighter because the lower harmonics of the strings aren't as present. Conversely, when the pickup is placed more towards the neck of the guitar, the sound is more "boomy".</p>

      </div>
 
      
      <p>Pickups can be used in combination with each other. One of the best examples is with the Stratocaster. Throughout the 50', 60's and 70's, Fender installed a three-way switch so players to could choose the bridge ("bright") pickup, the neck ("boomy") pickup, or the middle pickup. However, players discovered that if they put the switch <em>between</em> positions, they got a unique, "chucky" or "hollow" sound. Starting in 1977, Fender included a <em>five</em>-way switch so the mid positions were available immediately<sup>[<a href="#references" class="reference">6</a>]</sup>. The mid positions create the "classic" Fender Stratocaster sound.
